## Hardware Bill of Materials

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (~$30)
| Component | Estimated Cost | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| **ESP32 Dev Board** | $5-8 | BLE + WiFi controller | Any ESP32 works |
| **ELM327 BLE Adapter** | $8-12 | OBD-II interface | Budget for unreliability |
| **USB Car Charger (5V)** | $5 | Power source | Use existing one |
| **Micro USB Cable** | $3 | Power + programming | |
| **Breadboard + Jumpers** | $5 | Prototyping | Optional |

**Total: ~$25-35**

### Phase 2: Production Upgrade (~$50 additional)
| Component | Cost | Why Upgrade? |
|----------|------|--------------|
| **Veepeak/Viecar BLE Adapter** | $25-30 | 10x more stable connection |
| **Automotive Buck Converter** | $8-12 | Voltage protection, cleaner power |
| **ABS Enclosure** | $5-8 | Professional mounting |
| **External WiFi Antenna** | $3-5 | Better signal in metal car body |

**Upgrade only after validating the concept with cheap hardware.**
